# MARL methods in mpe environment
This is a record for my learning process during Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 

## Instructions  
Download the multiagent-particle-environment from github and open a terminal then `cd` into the root directory (where setup.py exists). Then use command  
>python setup.py install  
to install the mpe environment.
